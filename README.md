# Service B2C Dynamic Load
Load new database values from an integration into current view without a workspace refresh

Sometimes we need to display in real time data obtained from integrations performed using systems such as Oracle Integration Cloud. In those cases it is necessary to refresh the workspace to show data that have been updated in the database after having loaded it on screen.

With this BUI extension it is possible to define the fields that we want to monitor and when detecting a change in the database, display the new data without having to reload/refresh the workspace.
